# Rarttling off some useful things in my head

## Bash

echoing the IP address we'll be working with makes it asier to keep track of that and makes it easier to use in scripts

```
echo IP=10.10.0.0
```
then it can be combined with other examples:

```
nmap -sC -sV $IP
```
or 
```
ping $IP
```

## /dev/null

/dev/null is like a black hole for output that you don't want in your scripts.

for example

```
if host 'example.com' &> /dev/null/; then 
	echo 'host.com'
fi	
```
