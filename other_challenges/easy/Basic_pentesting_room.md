2018-04-23: I've been messing with that struts stuff, and it's pretty cool! I think it might be neat
to host that on this server too. Haven't made any real web apps yet, but I have tried that example
you get to show off how it works (and it's the REST version of the example!). Oh, and right now I'm 
using version 2.5.12, because other versions were giving me trouble. -K

2018-04-22: SMB has been configured. -K

2018-04-21: I got Apache set up. Will put in our content later. -J

For J:

I've been auditing the contents of /etc/shadow to make sure we don't have any weak credentials,
and I was able to crack your hash really easily. You know our password policy, so please follow
it? Change that password ASAP.

nmap scan to see which ports are open
```
nmap -v -A $IP > scan.txt 
```
thought I'd slam them in a text file.

next we followed a guide that tried

```
enum4linux -a <MACHINE IP>
```

```
hydra -t 4 -u jan -P /Downloads/rockyou.txt ssh://$IP
```



1 	Deploy the machine and connect to our network 

2 	Find the services exposed by the machine

3 	What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server(enter name without /)?

4 	User brute-forcing to find the username & password

5 	What is the username? Jan

6 	What is the password? armando

7 	What service do you use to access the server(answer in abbreviation in all caps)?

8 	Enumerate the machine to find any vectors for privilege escalation

9 	What is the name of the other user you found(all lower case)? kay

10 	If you have found another user, what can you do with this information?

11 	What is the final password you obtain?
